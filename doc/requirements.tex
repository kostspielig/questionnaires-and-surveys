\chapter{Introduction}
This document is the software requirements specification for an open source web application for questionnaires and surveys.

\section{Purpose}
This document outlines the online survey system describing its system requirements for the production of  a functional system, as well as user requirements in order to produce software compliant with the user's needs. We define the assumptions used to create the system, and provide use-case diagrams representing the system functionality and relationships.

The following  document is intended to be a third version of the requirements that must be formalized later. 

\subsection{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended for developers, project managers, users, testers and documentation writers. The main sections contained are an {\it Introduction} that contains information and instructions about the document. An {\it Overall Description} that gives a general idea of the product being specified in this SRS. The {\it Requirements}, describing the characteristics of the software. And the {\it Use Case Diagram}, to pressent a graphical overview of the functionality provided by the system.

\section{Overview}
Jon Sprouse of the Department of Cognitive Sciences at UCI is studying grammatical theory through surveys--both online and in the field. These surveys require careful construction through colors, ordering, and other various textual attributes to provide useful data for his work. In order to assist his research, a web-based system that generates these surveys provides efficiency and automation that would otherwise be done manually and intensively.


\chapter{Overall description}

\section{Product perspective}
This product aims to fill an existing need. Although there are many different choices for online survey generators, such as limeSurvey or SurveyMonkey, none of these options  seem to meet the requirements that are needed.

Developing into a web-based interface, the survey system is intended to contain customizable functionalities during survey creation, multiple version creation, and allow for survey participation. Customizations include both font attribute and layout manipulation, allowing the administrator to invoke different psychological responses from the participant. Multiple versions allow for the juxtaposition and analysis of participant responses with the use of "same-content, different-layout" environments.

\subsection{System interfaces}
The software will have an {\it admin interface}. This interface will allow the administrator to perform several tasks.
\begin{itemize}
\item Upload experiments.
\item Download results.
\item Change appearance.
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample display at bottom that shows real time changes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User interfaces}
The main features that the software will present are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Sets of surveys}, allowing the user to automatically loop through them.
\item {\it Pseudo-Randomization} of the order of the surveys.
\item {\it Result file}. This file will contain these main fields: Subject ID, survey number, code and responses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
The software should run on a wide range of hardware. Please note that much of the computer equipment might have heterogeneous and unpredictable characteristics. Should the software run on a wide range of hardware. The web characteristics such as AJAX should not be abused because they do not work in older browsers and require more resources on the client side.

\subsection{Software interfaces}
The software should run on Windows. The software must be compatible with MS Excel and the main Internet web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.

\subsection{Communications interfaces}
The software must communicate with the clients' browsers via HTTP over TCP / IP.
\subsection{Memory}
There is no objective measure, but given the characteristics of the hardware described, it should be noted that the web portal should be light. There will not be more than two hundred surveys at the same time.


\subsection{Operations}
There are different roles in the organization that defines the operational mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\it Administrator} is responsible for uploading the surveys and questionnaires.
\item The {\it Participant} can register in the web page. It should be able to configure its preferences and consult its surveys and results.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Site adaptation requirements}
There are no site adaptation requirements, besides those already discussed above.

\section{Product functions}
Broadly, the main functions of the software will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Surveys management by the administrator.
\item Ability to answer the survey by the participants.
\end{itemize}
\section{User characteristics}
There are two different user types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\it Administator}. Middle class people with different computer literacy. Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Has the ability to transfer files over FTP.
       	\item Must have an Admin account to login to manage surveys.
        \item The Administrator should be able to use the Control Panel to DL/UL surveys to/from the server.
        \item Ability to edit xlsx files and understand how to apply attributes to the survey prior to upload.
\end{itemize}
	\item {\it Participant}. Young people who are very familiar with the technologies. They will have to access to the URL for a given experiment.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Constraints}
\section{Assumptions and dependencies}

These requirements have been developed by making some assumptions based on characteristics of users and the general descriptions of equipment on which it will use the software. % These requirements may have additional costs deducted and the customer may consider deleting it finds that there has been an over-specification of the software.
